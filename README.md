<summary><strong>👨‍💻 About Me</strong></summary>

<br/>

I enjoy building applications from concept to deployment and understanding the **why** behind the tools I use — not just plugging things together.  
I’m naturally curious and constantly learning in an ever-expanding tech landscape, with a strong focus on fundamentals and real-world impact.  
Right now, I’m on a journey to become a well-rounded software engineer by building meaningful, high-impact projects.
